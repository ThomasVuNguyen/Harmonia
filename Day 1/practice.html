<h1> The Best Movies, according to Thomas Nguyen</h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies of all times!</h2>

<hr>
<h3>Deadpool 3</h3>
<p> The action, the comedy, the inside jokes, just great *chef kiss*</p>
<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy 3</h3>
<p> The stakes, the action, the music, and the visuals, James Gunn is killing it</p>
<h3>Spiderverse 2</h3>
<p>Music & visuals blend in so well together, with the inside jokes, it just keeps on coming. It's a great time to be a nerd</p>
